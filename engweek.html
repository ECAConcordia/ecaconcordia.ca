          <strong>Description:</strong>
          <p>
            The often complex work of engineers forces them to rely on abstract and intangible concepts. This is why they must know how to simplify and communicate their knowledge in a clear and concise way with the general public. This competition is designed to force its participants to demonstrate their communicative skills by clearly explaining the operation of a device/process or a complex engineering subject.
