<p>Every year, after reading week, we take some time to celebrate engineering. So the ECA has organized free events throughout the week. This includes a talk by an alumni Nick Zacchia; free breakfasts; 2 competitions - the forever popular Troitsky and IEEE's great RoboWars; and much more!</p>

<h3 id="speaker">Guest Speaker: Nick Zacchia</h3>
<p>Nick Zacchia is an engineer by training. Originally from Montreal, his love of taking things apart quickly led him to building robots, lots of them, throughout his undergrad at Concordia University. He followed that up with some surfing and a Master`s degree in California studying biophysics. Missing the cold weather, he decided to work towards his PhD here at TRIUMF and UBC, studying ways to develop new tracers for medical imagining.</p>
<i>March 6th — 1pm to 2pm — location TBD</i>
<br>

<h3 id="troitksy">Troitsky</h3>
<p>More than 20 teams of engineers coming from across North America to build bridges made out of wooden toothpicks, popsicle sticks, white glue, and dental floss? That's the TROITSKY BRIDGE BUILDING COMPETITION! </p>
<p>The competition is divided in 3 events: the <i>building</i> when all the teams assemble their bridges, the <i>presentations</i> held in front of the judges, and finally the most anticipated moment, the <i>bridge CRUSHING</i>!</p>
<p>And the best part about it is that they're all open to the public. So don't forget to pass by and witness this unique competition! If you really can't wait and want a preview, check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V36pYLUkaDM">video below</a>.</p>
<i>Building: March 6th — 10am to 2pm — EV building, atrium</i><br>
<i>Presentations: March 6th — 2:30pm to 6pm — H 110</i><br>
