## Executives  
The Board of Directors, composed of the 8 executives, run the day-to-day operations and make decisions for the Associations. 

### Emma Saboureau, President

Hello everyone,  
A bit about me, I was born and raised in France and decided to move to Montréal last year in order to study Computer Science at Concordia.  
I got directly involved in student life by being VP Marketing for the ECA where I discovered that university was about more than just going to class and going home; it’s also about meeting other students, organizing awesome events, being a leader, empowering people, and trying to juggle between academics and student involvement. As it was such a memorable experience that I decided to stay an executive for another year and make your university experience even better!  
So say “hi” when I hand you a drink at our Lizard Lounge or drop by the office (H-838), if I’m not napping in front of my computer or consuming insane amounts of Red Bull, tell me what I can do for you.  

### Michael Davila, VP Internal

Hello,  
Hope everyone has had a great summer vacation and is ready for a new year! I am in my second year at Concordia in Mechanical Engineering and I’m looking forward to being a part of the ECA. If anyone one else is looking for something extra at school I recommend getting involved and meeting new people. I look forward to meeting many of your new faces at all of our events and parties. Come by the 8th floor and meet the team!

### Kyle Arseneau, VP External 
_external@ecaconcordia.ca_  
“Most of you know who I am so far, but for the newcomers here’s my life story” -Kyle Arseneau.  
Born and raised in the greater Montreal Area, I’ve always called Montreal my home, and I always knew I wanted to become an Engineer. I’m currently in my 4th year of Building Engineering, and so far, have been involved as a ENCS CSU Councillor, CUBES President and director of finance for the ECA.  
This year I figured I’d step it up a notch and attempt to represent 3700+ of the most awesome people I know as your VP External. I’ll be your liaison to the outside world, and I’ll do my best to portray the best image possible, or at least I’ll try!
Don’t be shy to say hello, I’m the friendliest person ever.
Have a great 2k14-2k15 year!  

### Dante Trunzo, VP Finance

Hey Guys,  
You maybe asking yourself who is the lucky guy that gets to manage all of my money. Well I am a fourth year Mechanical Engineering student with uncanny abilities in Excel. Every year the ECA manages close to 500,000$ of student money, and we use it to try and make your time at Concordia a little special. We fund student projects, societies, competition teams and all kinds of awesome events. I hope you will take the time to get involved, represent us at competitions and take advantage of the services we offer. I promise you will have an amazing time, and you will learn tons of things they just don’t teach in the classroom. If you see me around campus, don’t be shy and come say hi! I love meeting new people, and I would love to hear your ideas and concerns.  

### Amal Bouanani, VP Social 
_social@ecaconcordia.ca_  
What’s up people!  
I’m thrilled to be this year’s VP Social and do what I love the most, which is to be part of awesome events and organizing them.  
Few words about me, well I dropped out of school and came back after 8 years! Why? Because I had bigger dreams, dormant potential, and was still full of life. All this to tell you is that everything is possible and nothing is too late if you put your mind to it. I’m now in my 3rd year in Building Engineering and knowing that I came thus far feels amazing and being part of the engineering association even better! So what I’d like to pass on to you is, it is What you do within those 4+ years that will make your experience in engineering worth it and worthwhile. Concordia is such a diverse university, it is a really good start for you to understand and to open your mind to different walks of life. My goal as your VP Social is to help you to a take break from your crazy schedule with cool events, drinking or not, inside or outside, whatever floats your boat, we have cool things planned for yall, give it try!  
Get involved you’ll be amazed of how much you have in common with your other classmates. So whenever you can take a break or simply just want to have fun come to our future events!  
Ciao see you soon!  

### Katherine Kokmanian, VP Academic 
_academic@ecaconcordia.ca_  
Hello fellow students!  
My name is Katherine Kokmanian and I am a Mechanical Engineering student in the Co-operative Education program. I am currently entering my fourth and final year at Concordia University.

To all first year students, welcome! Please do not hesitate to come say hello, your suggestions are always appreciated. I am very eager to help you perform to the fullest of your potential.

### Kimberly Yeung, VP Sports and Competitions 
_comps@ecaconcordia.ca_  
During my first semester at Concordia, I didn’t get involved in any extracurricular activities because I thought that I wouldn’t be able to keep up with my studies and my social life.   Thankfully, during my second semester, I decided to participate in the Troitsky Bridge Building Competition and it was a great experience!  
During my second year, I decided to participate in the Quebec Engineering Competitions and it was the best experience EVER. Being a part of these competitions made me want to get more and more involved in extracurricular activities and motivated me to become a VP for the Concordia Society of Civil Engineers and to join the awesome society known as Enggames during my third year of University.  
My goal this year as VP Sports and Competitions is to make your University experience as enjoyable as mine is, if not better.
