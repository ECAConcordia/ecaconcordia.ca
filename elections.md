What’s Up Everyone!  
I am a Mechanical Engineering student part of the cooperative education program, currently completing my second year. After 5 semesters of school and being involved in various engineering societies, I have seen all the ups and downs within the ENCS faculty.   
Now I am excited and ready to be your VP social with the objective of bringing the Engineering community closer together. I have worked as an event organizer outside of school, organizing birthdays, community gatherings, and anniversaries. I want to bring my creativity and experiences to the ECA by taking social events to the next level.  CASA JMSB who? People are going to be talking about our events all year!

- Ryan Wong – VP Social  
Hello, my name is Ryan Wong and I'm running for VP Social for ECA at Concordia.   
To tell you a bit about myself, I am studying mechanical engineering in my third year, and am also part of the Co-operative Institute in which I have already completed two work semesters at Dassault Systèmes. Aside from engineering, I am a passionate hockey player and music lover. I enjoy reading, dancing and singing (which you may have had the un-pleasantries of hearing), and am always looking forward to meeting new people.  
As a VP social candidate, my goals are to increase Concordia engineering school spirit while simultaneously creating more opportunities for students to meet, socialize, and network. This entails restoring weekly lizard lounge events, and extending operative hours well past 7:00pm.   
Furthermore, I would like to implement more social events which do not revolve around the consumption of alcohol. There are many fun ways to do this, such as sport themed days, movie nights, etc.

- Sabrine Daou – VP Marketing & Communications  
Hello everyone! I am only allowed around 100 words, therefore I will make this short and sweet. My name is Sabrine Daou, and I am going onto my third year as an undergraduate student in Industrial Engineering. My mandate as the President of the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE), Concordia Chapter is coming to an end. I have therefore decided to take part in the ECA to continue to give back to students and help them with their progression as an undergraduate student in Engineering here at Concordia University. From my engagement with the IIE, I have mainly developed strong communication and team work skills that I am ready to apply once again, as an executive of the ECA for the upcoming year 2015-2016.  

- Dilany Abeywirckrama – VP Academic  
Hello There!  
I am a Mechanical Engineering, CO-OP student entering my final year. Current MIE Representative for ECA, Mentor for institute of Co-Operative education and VP Finance for Concordia Dodgeball League.  
Goals:  
    -	Improve communication with the student body
    -	Bring about a transparent, well defined tutor hiring process  
    -	Improve laboratories and curriculum  
    -	Host Seminars to improve your engineering knowledge.   

    Having worked with ECA and a good rapport with faculty, I am confident in being a better liaison between students and faculty.   
    YOUR Ideas + YOUR Suggestions + MY Efforts = OUR Improved Education System.

- Leo Collard – CSE Rep  
Hello! I am a third year Co-Op Software Engineering student who would like to run for the position of SOEN/CS Representative. Currently I am a member of the Garnet Key Society. Through my involvement in this organization I have had the pleasure of representing and serving Concordia. For my last year, I would like be a part of the ECA. I would continue the previous representative’s efforts to find an alternative to SOEN 385. I believe that it would be beneficial for students to have a core C++ or DBMS class. Another favorable change would be the reduction of the presence of outdated software tools in the curriculum and replace them with viable industry grade equivalents.
