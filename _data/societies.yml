    After yet another amazing year, the veteran group of executives this year are looking forward to continuing the CSCE traditions. The imaginative and poignant members of this society welcome all to take part in their shear and slightly bending moments of awesomeness.  
    Having several years of experience at Concordia, the members realized they had a mutual admiration of each other’s talents, a strong desire to make a difference and a keen drive to teach others - and we hope that many of you will take advantage of our knowledge and wisdom.  
    Every year, the CSCE host several events, as well as compete in all the concrete competitions. The competitive teams of Concrete Canoe, Concrete Toboggan and The Troitsky Bridge Building Competition are all actively seeking members to get started on applying engineering theory to design and build a winning entry in each competition.  
    Living in Montreal can be difficult for the student balance but we will show you how to have the most fun possible while surviving keg stands, infinite loops, wilderness excursions, Lizard Lounge debauchery and boat races against mirrors. We are known as the party society for a reason.

    With a splash of new talent, and the wisdom of veteran members, it is guaranteed that CUBES will soar to new heights in this coming year. Expect to be invited to a wide range of activities hosted by your CUBES committee.  
    These activities will range from various site tours of some of the most interesting construction projects ongoing within the greater Montreal area. We will also be hosting tutorials to help aid students in programs that are sometimes overlooked by our BCEE program such as MATLAB.  
    Now with all this serious stuff aside, CUBES also hosts some less-academic events, such as our semi-annually Wine & Cheese where students, professors and professionals from diverse engineering firms around Montreal gather together. This allows student to start networking and maybe even get an interview!  
    This is a brief introduction to what Cubes is. A full list of our activities with their expected dates will be coming to our Facebook page, https://www.facebook.com/groups/CUBES.eca/. Feel free to check it out, and if you have any questions, or better yet suggestions, we encourage you contact us through our email!

- name: EngGames 
  description: |
    As the last remaining Competitive Society under the ECA, our team is set to assemble a delegation of 44 of Concordia’s most socially representative students at the province’s largest engineering competition: the Quebec Engineering Games. This event challenges teams from 11 different universities both mentally and physically in competitions such as field-specific theory, consulting, machine design, sports, and debates, to name a select few.  
    Being a half social, half academic event, Engineering Games provides a fantastic opportunity to network both among other students and among potential employers in a fun, casual environment. While each university strives to achieve glory and distinguish themselves among the rest, the most important aspect of the Games lies in the fact that it enables students to establish a large network of aspiring engineers. Their paths will undoubtedly cross in the future, and having these pre-established bonds is a precious and extremely useful asset in one’s career.  
    Many ex-delegates will attest to the fact that many of their fondest Concordia memories were made as a direct result of having participated in the Games. If you’d like to make the best of your university years while simultaneously investing into your future, consider trying out for the EngGames Team—you won’t regret it.

    Do you want to meet more people like you? Ambitious students looking to broader their professional network and excel academically. Who are interested in helping each other to succeed as a group instead of being in competition? Who has the desire to make a positive difference in this world and learn how to optimize your time? Who wants to travel and network with young promising professionals across the globe? NSBE is for you.  
    The National Society of Black Engineers is an association that had its humble beginnings in 1971, in the United State with a powerful mission. Initially, the purpose of the association was to bring support and structure to the students that were in a minority. Alarming ratio stated that 80% of the black engineers would drop out after the first year. Facing such impasse, NSBE was created, as a family to sustain the future of this nation. Today, NSBE has grown into an international association, reaching over 35 000 members in close to 400 chapter in several continent.  
    Our goal is to increase the number of minority students studying engineering, science, math and technology at both the undergraduate and graduate level. We also target the youth to encourage and advise their pursuit of an engineering career. This association is for anyone who believes in NSBE’s mission.  
    We have lots of great programs planned for the year, such as community outreach, study-session, volunteering, raising funds, get-togethers, and much more. One of the highlights of the year is our annual Convention, which offers members a chance to visit different state and attend interesting workshops and a major career fair involving approximately 11 000 members across the world. A member chose to which extent they wish to be involved.  
    We enjoy meeting new people and hearing fresh ideas, if you are interested, you may contact us by email, Facebook, or at the office.
